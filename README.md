# Medical questionnaire Flutter app

A Desktop application made with Flutter for asking medical questions from an elderly person.

The questions are answered with either multiple choice answers or spoken language. 

The app records the spoken answers to a file and sends them to a Python Flask back end along with the multiple choice answers.

The back end returns an AI generated summary from all the multiple choice answers and spoken answers. 

The AI generated summary is displayed on the app.
